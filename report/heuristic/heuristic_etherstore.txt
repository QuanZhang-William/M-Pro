==== Integer Overflow ====
SWC ID: 101
Type: Warning
Contract: EtherStore
Function name: withdrawFunds(uint256)
PC address: 574
This binary add operation can result in integer overflow.

==== Dependence on predictable environment variable ====
SWC ID: 116
Type: Warning
Contract: EtherStore
Function name: withdrawFunds(uint256)
PC address: 628
In the function `withdrawFunds(uint256)` the following predictable state variables are used to determine Ether recipient:
- block.timestamp
- block.timestamp
- block.timestamp

--------------------

msg.sender.call.value(_weiToWithdraw)()

==== Ether thief ====
SWC ID: 105
Type: Warning
Contract: EtherStore
Function name: withdrawFunds(uint256)
PC address: 628
Users other than the contract creator can withdraw ETH from the contract account without previously having sent any ETH to it. This is likely to be vulnerability.

msg.sender.call.value(_weiToWithdraw)()

--------------------

==== Message call to external contract ====
SWC ID: 107
Type: Warning
Contract: EtherStore
Function name: withdrawFunds(uint256)
PC address: 628
This contract executes a message call to the address of the transaction sender. Generally, it is not recommended to call user-supplied addresses using Solidity's call() construct. Note that attackers might leverage reentrancy attacks to exploit race conditions or manipulate this contract's state.

msg.sender.call.value(_weiToWithdraw)()

--------------------

==== State change after external call ====
SWC ID: 107
Type: Warning
Contract: EtherStore
Function name: withdrawFunds(uint256)
PC address: 719
The contract account state is changed after an external call. Consider that the called contract could re-enter the function before this state change takes place. This can lead to business logic vulnerabilities.
--------------------
In file: solidity_examples/etherstore.sol:18

balances[msg.sender] -= _weiToWithdraw

==== State change after external call ====
SWC ID: 107
Type: Warning
Contract: EtherStore
Function name: withdrawFunds(uint256)
PC address: 787
The contract account state is changed after an external call. Consider that the called contract could re-enter the function before this state change takes place. This can lead to business logic vulnerabilities.

==== Integer Overflow ====
SWC ID: 101

Contract: EtherStore
Function name: depositFunds()
